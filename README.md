# iMessage2
This program requires a valid gmail account to run as it uses gmail's servers to send the text messages.  To run this program simply enter your gmail username and password (seperated by a single space) in the iMessageLog.txt. You will also have to allow 3rd party apps to access the gmail account in gmail settings.
